## üöÄ Features

- **Scheduled Pill Dispensing:** Uses RTC module to release pills at specific times using a servo motor.
- **Voice Interaction:** Accepts spoken commands to query information or interact with the system.
- **AI Integration:** GPT-2 responds to medication-related queries using natural language.
- **Alerts & Display:** IR sensor detects user presence, and buzzer + LCD provides notifications.
- **Simulated Hardware:** Circuit built and tested in Wokwi simulator.
